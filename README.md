# Energy Meter Monitoring System

This Big Data project was developed for the Systems for Processing Big Data course at NOVA University Lisbon. 

It focuses on processing and analyzing energy meter data using Apache Spark and Spark Streaming to handle both real-time and batch data processing. The system is designed to provide insights into energy consumption, detect anomalies and optimize energy usage patterns.
